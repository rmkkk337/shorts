This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install required packages:

```bash
npm i
```

Make sure to have `lib/conf.ts` file containing

```
export const HOST_DNS = http://your_dns_here
```

so API will work correctly

Then run development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build a web application use this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run a production build use:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
